        <p>  I was born in the Philippines but moved to the U.S. when I was 4. I didn't know how to speak English when I got here so I looked and sounded like an idiot. I like to play a lot of sports such as basketball, soccer, and i liked to surf. I also love fashion, i even created a page just about fasion. </p>
